We all love to play games. But little we know that games can be used as a means to solve complex optimization problems. Game theory is what this is about.

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. In simple words, the Game theory is the study of how and why people make decisions. It helps an agent or a decision-maker to make decisions that may maximize the specified outcomes. Its main aim is to maximize the payoff that an agent will get by taking certain actions.

Game theory is extensively used in economics, computer science, social sciences, humanities, natural sciences, engineering, and also biology.

I tried to create a simple game of Tic Tac Toe using Game Theory, specifically the minimax algorithm. It tries all the possible moves and takes the best move possible at the current time. The game is nearly unbeatable.
